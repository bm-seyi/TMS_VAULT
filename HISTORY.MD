## 0.0.1
First development version

## 0.0.2
### Fixed/Updated
- Modified the [`docker-build`](.github/workflows/docker-build.yml) workflow to run on a GitHub-hosted runner instead of a self-hosted one.  

- Updated the [`entrypoint.sh`](entrypoint.sh) script to ensure the correct address is used for local development.

### Removed
- Deleted unintended code at the end of the [`README.md`](README.md) that was mistakenly committed.
